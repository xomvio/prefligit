[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

prek is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.

> [!WARNING]
> This project was previously named `prefligit`, but it has been renamed to `prek` to avoid typosquatting issues.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in early stage of development, some features are still not implemented.
> It is not production-ready yet, but feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
>
> Current supported languages are `python`, `node`, `go`, `docker`, `docker-image`, `system`, `script` and `fail`.

## Features

- 🚀 A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ⚡ About [10x faster](https://github.com/j178/prek/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md) than `pre-commit` and uses only a third of disk space.
- 🔄 Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- 🐍 Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- 🛠️ Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- 📦 Built-in implementation of some common hooks.
- 🏗️ (TODO) Built-in support for monorepos.

## How to migrate

prek is designed as a drop-in replacement:

- [Install prek](#installation).
- Replace `pre-commit` with `prek` in your commands
- Your existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` works unchanged

```console
$ prek run
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
typos....................................................................Passed
cargo fmt................................................................Passed
cargo clippy.............................................................Passed
```

For configuring `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and writing hooks, you can refer to the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) as prek is fully compatible with it.

## Why prek?

### prek is way faster

- It is about [10x faster](https://github.com/j178/prek/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md) than `pre-commit` and uses only a third of disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, built in prek, which are faster than their Python counterparts.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- (TODO): Built-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each sub-project can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- `prek run` has some improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
    - `prek run --directory <dir>` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- <dir> | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
    - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
- (TODO): prek provides shell completions for `prek run <hook_id>` command, so you can easily find the available hooks.

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn't be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I've learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.
